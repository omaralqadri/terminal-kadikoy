### 📝 Needs Your Input
1. **Images**: Add 3 PNG images to `assets/images/onboarding/`
   - onboarding_1.png
   - onboarding_2.png
   - onboarding_3.png

2. **Descriptions**: Update placeholder text in localization files
   - Current: "Açıklama metni" / "Description text"

## How to Run

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/omaralkadri/StudioProjects/terminal_kadikoy

# Install dependencies (already done)
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### First Launch
1. App will show onboarding screens
2. You can skip or go through all screens
3. After completion, you'll see the home screen

### Subsequent Launches
- App goes directly to home screen
- Onboarding won't show again

### To Reset (For Testing)
Add this code somewhere and call it:
```dart
await OnboardingService.resetOnboarding();
// Then restart the app
```

## Generic Button Usage Examples

The enhanced `CustomButton` is now available throughout your app:

```dart
// Onboarding style (fully rounded)
CustomButton.rounded(
  text: 'Başlayalım',
  onPressed: () {},
  backgroundColor: Color(0xFFFF6F00),
  width: double.infinity,
  height: 56,
)

// Regular button
CustomButton(
  text: 'Submit',
  onPressed: () {},
  showIcon: false,
)

// Button with custom radius
CustomButton(
  text: 'Save',
  onPressed: () {},
  borderRadius: 12,
  backgroundColor: AppColors.success,
)

// Loading state
CustomButton(
  text: 'Processing',
  onPressed: () {},
  isLoading: true,
)
```

## API Integration Plan

When your API is ready:

1. **Update Provider** (`onboarding_provider.dart`):
   ```dart
   Future<void> loadFromApi() async {
     final response = await api.getOnboardingScreens();
     state = state.copyWith(items: response);
   }
   ```

2. **Change Images** to network loading:
   ```dart
   Image.network(item.imageUrl, ...)
   ```

3. **Model is ready**: Already has `fromJson/toJson` methods
